            The <ExternalLink to={REPO_LINK}>repository</ExternalLink> is holding the code for both {PRODUCT_NAME}{' '}
            package and the documentation website you‚Äôre looking at.
            <br />
            Since the repo root contains a <Code>yarn.lock</Code> file, <strong>it should be obvious</strong> that you
            have to use <ExternalLink to="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</ExternalLink> to install dependencies and run
            scripts.
            <br />
            Use <Code>yarn dev</Code> to start the development server, <Code>yarn lint</Code> to check the code for
            linting errors, and <Code>yarn build</Code> to check that the code compiles.
            <br />
            Running <Code>yarn format</Code> will automatically format your code with{' '}
            <ExternalLink to="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</ExternalLink>, so that it adheres to the project‚Äôs coding
            style.

            <br />
            <strong>Make sure you have a good grasp of the above before attempting to contribute.</strong>
            <br />
            The {PRODUCT_NAME} package code is located in the <Code>package</Code> folder, while the documentation
            website code is located in the <Code>app</Code> folder.
            <br />
            The <Code>components</Code> folder holds generic React components used by the documentation website.

            If you want to implement a new feature or improve an existing one, make sure to add an example page and/or
            alter the one(s) already referring to it.
            <br />
            It‚Äôs not a feature if other people don‚Äôt know about it or don‚Äôt understand how to use it.

      <PageSubtitle value="Why do repository stars matter" />
      <Txt>
        The more stars this repository gets, the more visibility it gains among the Mantine users community. The more
        users it gets, the more chances that some of those users will become active code contributors willing to put
        their effort into bringing new features to life and/or fixing bugs.
        <br />
        As the repository gain awareness, my chances of getting hired to work on Mantine-based projects will increase,
        which in turn will help maintain my vested interest in keeping the project alive.
